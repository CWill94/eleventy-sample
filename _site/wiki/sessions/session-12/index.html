<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Recap: After gaining union citizenship paperwork to vote for BIlly as Baron. We talk to Chef-ry Dahmer and go to find the sentient fungi that he wants to cook. Oz/Zack meets The Other One who says he wants to (Spell Save DC is 35 btwwww)...</li>
<li>Leave OYK to guard the blimp</li>
<li>SM explains the underdark. There’s a city of denizens, the deep races in the below. Up is the historic mushroom fields and a wizards tower.</li>
<li>Step into the fairy circle and it drops us (think Tower of Terror) and land and the entrance to the Port of the Underdark. See about a dozen people in the main area. Duergar, Drow, etc.</li>
<li>Oz notices one human who sticks out amongst these deep races, sitting on a deck.</li>
<li>Chadlius</li>
<li>Not here by choice kind of on the run… slept around and pissed off some powerful people</li>
<li>6’ tall human. Strong jaw. Strapped with weapons. Shortsword. Breastplate. Longsword. Longbow. Backpack of climbing set and grappling hook. Basically a human shrek. Mid to late 20s.</li>
<li>We go to the Mayoral Office which is a Spider Lair now.</li>
<li>Chad shatters the door, we see many webs, up to medium sized creatures caught in webs</li>
<li>See a door with purple light emanating around it. Chad busts that door down as well. What are these rolls jeeze.</li>
<li>See spider queen? Dark elf fused to a spider body.</li>
<li>Chad tries to flirt with the spider queen and succeeds?</li>
<li>Oz asks about the violet fungus and the spider queen tells us it’s unnatural because it eats living creatures not dead. And the largest violet fungus is a decision maker? If the largest one is a bad guy, there’s a bad colony. Can we talk...</li>
