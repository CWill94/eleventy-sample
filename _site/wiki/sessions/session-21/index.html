<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Two Vistani so we have a party of Seven including the siblings and Lilyblossum.</li>
<li>Lilyblossum and Daggerford are in the front wagon.</li>
<li>Ilyna, her brother, me, and Reggie are in the back wagon. I ask about</li>
<li>Ilyna talks about her &quot;typical Borovian upbringing” going to the Church of the Sun King, playing with blinksey toys.</li>
<li>Says she’s 10, 27, and 40 years old…</li>
<li>(Is she Elena and Ilyna and Tatiana?)</li>
<li>I asked about her vampire bite and apparently she didn’t know she had it. I know that vampires don’t have souls. But I don’t know how to tell if she has a soul.</li>
<li>Ilyna says that sometimes Straud calls her Tatiana</li>
<li>We get attacked by Dorru who knocks out and grabs Ilyna. I try to cut him off but Reggie casually strolls out and banishes him. We set up an elaborate grease laden, light-cantripped hunting trap to try and get Dorru which fails unremarka...</li>
<li>Bart makes a hiding spot for Ilyna so she can’t just be snatched out of the wagon (Chad thinks of it but asks Bart pretty pretty please to do it)</li>
<li>[toolkits are not a one-use think you can re-use them]</li>
<li>Make it to the river ilvus crossroads (F) There’s a gallows and graves here for some ominous reason.</li>
<li>The vistani pull some old marigolds from their bags and lay them on the graves</li>
<li>“It’s important to honor the dead lest they dishonor you”</li>
</ul>
