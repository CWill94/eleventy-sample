<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Recap: [Heroes without a Team Name sounds like a pretty cool team name?] We went to Billowbarrow and got goosey/Porygon2 homunculus familiar worth 50k gold worth which only the potentate could even pay. As we are leaving we see the helic...</li>
<li>Now!</li>
<li>Bart takes a lot of damage from the pit..</li>
<li>One teenage girl has a spear with a human child skull that has blood all over from beating people…</li>
<li>Antler queen’s face is obscured with deer skin. But we see a hunger for violence in her eyes.</li>
<li>Another teen has completely dilated pupils, holding a book that looks like an adorned book of scripture</li>
<li>Another teen looks traumatized, she just looks super scared though she looks like she might be a leader, she has a bunch of spears on her back</li>
<li>Another teen, blonde, glasses, looks excited about catching something in the pit</li>
<li>Three more that are very forgettable and nameless</li>
<li>Misty cuts off my hair…Antler queen adds it to her gown.</li>
<li>I ask for safe passage which the Antler queen says she will permit as long as we survive the hunts tomorrow.</li>
<li>Oldyoungkenjamin sneaks away, his only good roll basically ever</li>
<li>We arrived at camp. Yurts from branches.</li>
<li>Antler queen looks at the spellcaster one - laddie? Laudie? - and tells her to give us her brew.</li>
</ul>
