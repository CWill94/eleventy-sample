<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Downtime which is happening concurrently - We’re all doing our stuff at the same time).</li>
<li>Chad Downtime - Chad as a former prize fighter gladiator wants to get a lay of the land, get some gossip, and maybe make some coin. So he looks for a fight club ring somewhere. Knows about the “Sticking Ring” which is a minor league, a l...</li>
<li>Kiv wants to connect with her deity. I walk up to the temple (haven’t met Ponzi so doesn’t really know better). New Church of Humanism. Symbols from many religions, all of which have been outlawed. There’s a statue of a long-haired human...</li>
<li>Bart is wandering around thinking about how all paths converge. He sees a few things of interest as he walks around town, sees Silverster going door to door trying to raise support for his Baron campaign, sees a long line for bread comin...</li>
<li>Now we all hear the alarm going off in our minds, the rapport spores sent out by Oz. Oz is currently paralyzed (for 1 hour). Chefry Dahmer is talking to himself about how guilty he feels but how much he is looking forward to the payment ...</li>
<li>We go on a long moral route of if we should kill Chefry with him negotiating and giving us non sincere platitudes about maybe not killing people for a while until Chad gets sick of it and stabs him through the heart.</li>
<li>We go on another moral spiral about evil in the world and decide to kill BIlly and the Baron and frame Silvester for the murder of all three.</li>
<li>Oz recovers and tries his best to stop him but we go on our murder spree and successfully frame Silvester.</li>
<li>Day of the caucus voting opens at the saloon. Silvester casts Zone of Truth around himself and says he is there to do what he said with the town. Oz steps in and says “Silvester is innocent!I know who murdered them! Oz, Kiv, and Bart!”</li>
<li>All dragons can shapeshift. We heard a rumor there was a dragon lair deep in the mine. It was Silvester, he is trying to basically expand his horde. The metallic dragons are not evil but they are focused on what they say they are. He wan...</li>
<li>Bart explains that although we did murder it was not for malicious intent. Oz is calling us murderers and trying to get us thrown in jail.</li>
<li>Bart and Chad step up to run for Baron against Silvester.</li>
<li>Bartholomew, Tough on Crime</li>
<li>Chadleous, Drain the Swamp</li>
</ul>
