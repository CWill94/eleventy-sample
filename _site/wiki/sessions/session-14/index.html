<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cowboy seems to look at Oz with some recognition. Kiv realizes, as a cleric I’m attuned to life and death better, that this guy is not undead but he looks like he should be. His body is modified mechanically. He looks like an artificer. ...</li>
<li>Gives us his number for the SENDING STONE WHICH OZ HAS DEFINITELY HAD SINCE ARGENTOWN. We can send a message to all our contacts once per day (not a once a day use but we cannot message the same person more than once per day).</li>
<li>Hook-Oars? Massive hook-like claws. Look like apex predators in the underdark. We start fighting them. Chad is the MVP. Kiv keeps basically tripping over her own feet. We kill them (thank you Chad and Bart) and make it to the “wizard tow...</li>
<li>Orb of Time Wondrous Item, common This orb can be used as an Arcane Focus. While holding the orb, you can take a Magic action to determine whether it is morning, afternoon, evening, or nighttime. This property functions only on the Mater...</li>
<li>Also finds a mystery key, shaped as though it was a question mark. 5% chance of opening any lock.</li>
<li>Mystery Key Wondrous Item, common A question mark is worked into the head of this key. The key has a 5 percent chance of unlocking any lock into which it’s inserted. Once it unlocks something, the key disappears. Notes: Utility, Exploration</li>
<li>One of the cups sitting on the desk also seems magical. Oz collects coffee mugs in his hut. This one is a ceramic mug that says “Don’t talk to me until I’ve had my coffee”</li>
<li>Tankard of Sobriety Wondrous Item, common This tankard has a stern face sculpted into one side. You can drink ale, wine, or any other nonmagical alcoholic beverage poured into it without becoming inebriated. The tankard has no effect on ...</li>
<li>Oz also tries to take the broom, it’s very intent upon its work trying to keep the place tidy. Oz asks if it would like to come with him to clean his blimp. He tries to grab it and it is unsuccessful. Broom seems to be wagging it’s tail ...</li>
<li>Potion of Longevity Potion, very rare When you drink this potion, your physical age is reduced by 1d6 + 6 years, to a minimum of 13 years. Each time you subsequently drink a Potion of Longevity, there is 10 percent cumulative chance that...</li>
<li>Bead of Force Wondrous Item, rare This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 Beads of Force are found together. You can take a Magic action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bea...</li>
<li>Displacer Beast!! Big ol kitty cat that we tame. That looks like it is going to have kittens. Name (per Lolf diary) is Nala.</li>
<li>Oz trips over his feet with his arms full of loot exiting the mage hut.</li>
<li>Chad reads the diary, the last page is about a month and a half ago. Talks about a “tricksy” sorcerer who didn’t make good on a promise, although the writer is more powerful than ever. Unfortunate what happened to the mycanids but she ne...</li>
