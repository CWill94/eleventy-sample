<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clay Recap: Bart the Great saved a new mushroom friend. Went down to the underdark and met a strange horny fellow, Chlamidia AKA Chadleous who was on the run for fucking or attempting to fuck someone’s wife. Asked for a backstory and he ...</li>
<li>Oz feels a</li>
<li>Wizard tower in the north</li>
<li>We are in the east, northeast is the violet fungus</li>
<li>Smell death and see a pontoon float along the river. Docks outside the spider queens lair. See a Duergar on the pontoon and we can see a pile of bodies on it. Super swollen bodies.</li>
<li>Pontoon goes to hell.</li>
<li>Level 1 - Limbo</li>
<li>Level 2 - Lust</li>
<li>Level 3 -Gluttony</li>
<li>Level 9 - Lilith Dragon Queen</li>
<li>Gave us each two soul coins each. We can fill it by stealing the soul from someone’s body. Without the coin will only take us as far as the beach before hell.</li>
<li>In this world when someone dies, unless they serve a god, goes to at least the first level of hell. It IS weird that there are bodies being transported there.. That’s not how people get to hell.</li>
<li>Looks like these bodies got strangled with the fungi. Could be contagious but only in close contact. Recalling that the spider queen’s lair was also covered in violet fungus…</li>
<li>“I know a guy named Rakey who buys [the bodies] for a single coin and then I go to the casino with it, great success” (why do they need the bodies? Who is eating them?)</li>
</ul>
