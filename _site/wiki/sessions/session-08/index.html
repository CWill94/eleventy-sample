<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Alexander is going a guest appearance playing OYK</li>
<li>OYK’s divine item is a dagger named Reba, has three charges per long rest that allows scrying and something else cool, check the discord</li>
<li>Recap: Party looted antler queen, went to camp to see Dick still alive. Card deck from the Antler Queen did us some gambling, though only OYK and Bart did it. More stuff…Green Bend… Dick is gone but will come back when he wants to. We ar...</li>
<li>Everyone gets Red Dream Token except Kiv</li>
<li>Kiv Dream: Entered the Temple of the Moon Maiden and is being approached by a Tiger who speaks to me “welcome sister to our mother’s temple. I didn’t expect we would meet like this but in this is my current projection. I am your brother ...</li>
<li>Flash forward. Young adult. I’m an adept cleric. One day a woman begins approaching the front doors. She collapses. She looks to be my age. I heal her a little and take her in, get her set up to be healed. Her village was attacked by rai...</li>
<li>Oz Dream: Jack has revealed his ambition to topple the gods and rule the world as a god. Since Oz refused he paralyzed him. Then Jack polymorphed Marelyn into a cat (Marelyn resists a bit and that’s why he’s a tiger). Jack then sucks Mar...</li>
<li>OYK Dream: In utero. Sees his mother laying on a bed in a old gothic-y looking room. A figure leans in and he kisses her and says “what do you think Olymankenjamin would think if he knew you’ve been lying to him all along. When your kid ...</li>
<li>Argtentown things we know. Where Bart grew up and where the murder he was accused of was committed. Much closer to the inner-baronies than Billowbarrow so it’s more populated, more trading opportunities, and not breaking down as much, bu...</li>
<li>OYK is a rogue so he listens to some chit-chat with some military folk. Apparently the Goodman told them to attack the city in two days, thinking that the citizens will be on their sides and take arms with them.</li>
<li>Helicopters are not here. Lilyblossum’s blimp is here though.</li>
<li>We use OYK’s scrying and see she’s down in the prison but has no weapons or holy symbol. So think commoner instead of paladin.</li>
<li>Other prisoners have IVs in them and look like they were experimented on to some degree. They’re also dead…</li>
<li>Yelp is a thing. We have on our passes to town that we are Yelp reviewers. Yelp is all on paper and people subscribe to it quarterly. We have to turn in our reports to the HQ at Calafia (or we would as actual Yelp reviewers).</li>
