<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reginald doesn’t care if we commoners die but Chad revives Bart and Bart revives Kiv.</li>
<li>Chad loots Ruth and gets a spell scroll containing a 4th level spell of invisibility? (anyone can use a spell scroll once) and a robe that is ambiguously good?</li>
<li>It looks nice enough. Nothing special about it. It wasn’t damaged because necrotic damage can only affect living things.</li>
<li>Obsidian disc is emitting a lot of power. Seems to be a little soul-sucking. Feels cool to the touch. Reginald knows that the dracolitch soul is tied to this. If the dracolitch is destroyed and this is still intact it just goes back to t...</li>

<li>Says Strahd is a friend</li>
<li>“Maturin hates the Other One and vice versa”</li>
<li>We used to be under Maturin’s circle “one day I [JK] am going to spit bile in his eye”</li>
