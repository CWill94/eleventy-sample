<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Recap: Goodman asked us to become his generals because he was impressed by us. Said his goal was equality for all people, but our party could be “more equal than others” in the new world. Goodman also hates Jack Kennerly. Said invasion o...</li>
<li>We win of course yay us.</li>
<li>See the former Baron of Billowbarrow who was hiding out the whole time.</li>
<li>Goodman does a speech and declares everyone honorary members of the Freedman’s Union. Elections will need to happen, former Baron of Billowbarrow is currently the only contender.</li>
<li>Lilyblossum shows up in the Zeppelin with Dick Gertrude, Bonnathan, and a new person - Tiefling with long, curling horns.</li>
<li>We go to the bar and Oz dictates a beautiful “Yelp Review” that Bart tries to write down on paper but only gets “Good Soup. 5 Stars.” He drops the review in the bag of holding.</li>
<li>We talk about dreams and there is an uncanny resemblance between Justin Case and Jack Kennerly (generic looking white man, greasy red hair to his shoulders, denim jacket with smiley face pins, jeans, and cowboy boots)</li>
<li>Timelines don’t seem to be lining up…</li>

<li>We pick mushrooms. Get 100gp if we can get this mushroom - tunnel in the woods outside of town between here and billowbarrow</li>
<li>Mycanids are a sentient race from the underdark - intelligent mushroom creatures connected like fungi in our world are. Kind of a hive mind but also individuals.</li>
<li>Tiefling (for Bart, Bastion Turn) Bart gives him the Argentine Bucks to invest</li>
