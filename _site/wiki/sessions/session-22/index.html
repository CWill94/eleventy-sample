<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bart Recap: We just traveled around Borovia. We didn’t do anything. No mill. No dinner. We just made a straight beeline to the town. We got to this interesting crossroads area and Reginald used “fly” to get the entire party… and long sto...</li>
<li>Chad has just done some bs to give Bart the help action on the performance check. We now see Chad walking towards the table to where the two muscly hunters are with a cask of wine.</li>
<li>See the boys running around, one of them is carrying a doll.</li>
<li>The strange bard man is heading upstairs and ducking around a corner.</li>
<li>A very large olive-skinned man begins to descend the stairs. Very bushy mustache and beard. Around his lipline and nose, his hair sticks straight out. Very bristly.</li>
<li>One of the bar go-ers watching Bart tell his story is not very interested.</li>
<li>Bart gets one night (free) stay in the “public quarters” for his performance. From the olive-skinned man. As well as free breakfast and dinner. 8 gold a night for the whole guest wing. Bart agrees to that. Irwin Martikov.</li>
<li>Doll is Ilyna Stavitch, young girl who went missing 7 years ago? Yes. Isek? is the doll maker? No. He collects dolls that look like Ilyna. Ilyna is afraid of him, because Urwin warns that Isek will have her killed and stuffed if he sees ...</li>
<li>Rectavio is the bard. He goes up and out of a secret door. Bart follows.</li>
<li>One of the bar guys, Earnst, (skinny, tall-ish, with a boring brown bowl cut) sneaks out (to tell people about us). Kiv follows him. Sees people in stocks with donkey heads on with people getting shit thrown at them. See slogans from the...</li>
<li>Bart following Rictavio. Finds the secret passage (S) which goes down to the stables. Finds him feeding his silver mare. Bart makes a joke about vampires and Rictavio gets very serious and asks if he’s here to hunt vampires or receive th...</li>
<li>(There’s two horses there. There’s a ladder to a loft overhead. There’s ravens nearby)</li>
<li>Bart whispers “we are here to hunt”. Rictavio asks if we have the required weapons and I think Bart indicates we don’t. Say to meet at town center tomorrow.</li>
<li>Ricktavio says if anyone needs he can provide protection in his vestibule (circus carriage), only one small creature can fit.</li>
</ul>
