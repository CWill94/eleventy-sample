<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Oz tames the ever sweeping broom at the Wizard Tower. REQUIRES ATTUNEMENT.</li>
<li>Baba Yaga’s Dancing Broom Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement) The archfey Baba Yaga crafted many of these magic brooms. No two appear exactly alike. While holding the broom, you can take a Magic action to transform it into an A...</li>
<li>(DONT FORGET ON THE BASTION TURN NEXT, OZ HAS A LIBRARY AND WE CAN CHECK A HISTORY BOOK DURING IT) [get it after 7 game days we get a turn]</li>
<li>Get to an area with little spore guys and Oz thinks about the value of life of sentient and non-sentient creatures and then obliterates them all single-handedly.</li>
<li>We get to the Violet Fungi dungeon room including a big Violet Fungi boss.</li>
<li>Oz climbs up to the ledge overlooking the Violet Fungus and lobs another fireball and kills all the minions again single handedly, then runs because he’s a squishy boi, but still takes damage from the boss mushroom’s spore attack</li>
<li>Chad lassos the fungi with the rope of mending (?) and then swings down past it. Bart jumps down in like a single leap and starts punching it.</li>
<li>Oz pulls out the deck of many things and pulls a card. Gets the Rogue. Nothing immediately happens. A NPC becomes hostile towards Oz and we don’t know who. Need the Wish spell to undo it. Bart has it but also seems hostile towards Oz. Dr...</li>
<li>Bart gets absorbed into the fungi hulk but Chad cuts him out. Bart then finishes it off with a single punch.</li>
<li>We have liberated the mushroom fields!</li>
<li>Spider Queen comes over and says she has a reward for us in her lair.</li>
<li>Chad shouts to her “Jack Kennerly sends his regards. Jack sent us to clear this out on his behalf and to claim it as his when we were done. [Is this Alexander’s like 10th crit this sesh??] also Jack wants us to claim the orb because he h...</li>
<li>Queen is confused and anguished. Asks how we know Jack and the orb. Chad says that he does work for him to be in his service. Doesn’t roll high enough to get her convinced to hand over the orb though.</li>
<li>Spider Queen says we can arrange with her to trade mushrooms (her dwairgar can farm instead of the mychanids).</li>
</ul>
