## Highlights
- Two Vistani so we have a party of Seven including the siblings and Lilyblossum.
- Lilyblossum and Daggerford are in the front wagon.
- Ilyna, her brother, me, and Reggie are in the back wagon. I ask about
- Ilyna talks about her "typical Borovian upbringing” going to the Church of the Sun King, playing with blinksey toys.
- Says she’s 10, 27, and 40 years old…
- (Is she Elena and Ilyna and Tatiana?)
- I asked about her vampire bite and apparently she didn’t know she had it. I know that vampires don’t have souls. But I don’t know how to tell if she has a soul.
- Ilyna says that sometimes Straud calls her Tatiana
- We get attacked by Dorru who knocks out and grabs Ilyna. I try to cut him off but Reggie casually strolls out and banishes him. We set up an elaborate grease laden, light-cantripped hunting trap to try and get Dorru which fails unremarka...
- Bart makes a hiding spot for Ilyna so she can’t just be snatched out of the wagon (Chad thinks of it but asks Bart pretty pretty please to do it)
- [toolkits are not a one-use think you can re-use them]
- Make it to the river ilvus crossroads (F) There’s a gallows and graves here for some ominous reason.
- The vistani pull some old marigolds from their bags and lay them on the graves
- “It’s important to honor the dead lest they dishonor you”
