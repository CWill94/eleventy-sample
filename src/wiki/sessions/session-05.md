## Highlights
- Tokens
- Oz - one black
- Kiv - one black, o ne red
- Lilyblossum, Old Young Kenjamin, Bonnathan, Baron, Goosey, and us are all here
- OYK wipes soot on his face and lies down, blending into the surroundings
- One of the two helicopters we see is green and has the emblem of the potentancy (closed fist squeezing out blood) Other one has the symbol of Chevexxonoco, The old place that my dad used to work for.
- Lilyblossum tries to get in her blimp and dip, Kiv hides on one of the balconies and transforms her cloak to look like the nearby areas
- Potentancy Helicopter: See a fella in a suit - rifle on his back - and a guard - with a pistol - get out
- Making his way to the blimp as a place of interest
- Oil Rig Helicopter: Two folks in khaki suits get out, we don’t know if they have any weapons or not
- One is in a protective jumpsuit with a gasmask over their face, they’re looking at a meter. We hear clicking sounds. Seems to be doing an inspection of their recently exploded property.
- See the groups exit the helicopters
- Baron falls on his knees. Thank goodness. Some ruffians came and whipped me, tried to sell me to bullywogs, and then robbed me!
- Dick waives at us, taps something, disappears, and then reappears and waives at us (he knows the Tiny Hut spell)
