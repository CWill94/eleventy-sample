## Highlights
- Recap: After gaining union citizenship paperwork to vote for BIlly as Baron. We talk to Chef-ry Dahmer and go to find the sentient fungi that he wants to cook. Oz/Zack meets The Other One who says he wants to (Spell Save DC is 35 btwwww)...
- Leave OYK to guard the blimp
- SM explains the underdark. There’s a city of denizens, the deep races in the below. Up is the historic mushroom fields and a wizards tower.
- Step into the fairy circle and it drops us (think Tower of Terror) and land and the entrance to the Port of the Underdark. See about a dozen people in the main area. Duergar, Drow, etc.
- Oz notices one human who sticks out amongst these deep races, sitting on a deck.
- Chadlius
- Not here by choice kind of on the run… slept around and pissed off some powerful people
- 6’ tall human. Strong jaw. Strapped with weapons. Shortsword. Breastplate. Longsword. Longbow. Backpack of climbing set and grappling hook. Basically a human shrek. Mid to late 20s.
- We go to the Mayoral Office which is a Spider Lair now.
- Chad shatters the door, we see many webs, up to medium sized creatures caught in webs
- See a door with purple light emanating around it. Chad busts that door down as well. What are these rolls jeeze.
- See spider queen? Dark elf fused to a spider body.
- Chad tries to flirt with the spider queen and succeeds?
- Oz asks about the violet fungus and the spider queen tells us it’s unnatural because it eats living creatures not dead. And the largest violet fungus is a decision maker? If the largest one is a bad guy, there’s a bad colony. Can we talk...
