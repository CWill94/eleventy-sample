## Highlights
- Recap and Housekeeping
- My shield is equipped now so it’s in one hand and my quarterstaff in the other - I don’t need to use my shield as an Action to have it equipped but it’s in one hand now
- Lillyblossom is a 3rd level Paladin now
- Kermit is a bullywog sage
- Goose is “worth it’s weight in gold” and is back in Billowbarrow “if it is still alive”
- Kermit is a moron, why did we let him do anything. Canonically he is a moron
- Old Young Kenjamin is a level 1 rogue now
- Lilyblossom is on her way to rescue us!
- Old Young Kenjamin jumps on the rope and is safe
- Frogger Toadman does NOT jump in the blimp, he just leaves… maybe forever
- After Bart does most of the damage with just his bare fists…. Not Oz or I with our cool spells…. A BULLYWOG KILLS THE DRAGON INSTEAD OF US
- All hail the dragonslayer
- Lilyblossom heals Oz instead of me because she loves old men
- We see that the Baron and Frogge Ttoadman are not in the blimp
