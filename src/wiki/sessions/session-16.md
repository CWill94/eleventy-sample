## Highlights
- Note: DM-spiration is stackable, can be given to others, and you do not need to declare that you are using it before you do. Heroic inspiration (what humans get when they sleep) does.
- Recap: We destroyed the Violet Fungi. After defeating it the Spider Queen emerged and said she would pay us and offer us a gift if we met her in her lair. Then we took a long rest.
- Bag of Holding starts going “System Restart Required” and starts chirping like a low battery fire alarm - Ends up it’s goosey
- The bag demon possessed goosey
- Said he went in the bag originally when a goat was killing his brothers
- Can basically function as a familiar? Encourages debauchery and murder
- Goosey AKA Ziploc says he will stick with us (lest we put him back in the bag)
- Bag demon is bad at rapping
- Asked where Chad was from, Califia
- At the spider Queen Lair she has two filled Soul Coins and a diamond worth (300gp?) which we definitely pick up, note that says “To the Yelpers”
- Chad tells us to get lost for 10 minutes and we do
- Chad alone goes into the lair with the queen
- Talked about how JK made her a drider by putting the orb in her chest, she was a drow before (“the highest of the races”). Chad asked if she was working for/with JK and she says he is just a means to an end.
- She acts like she’s going to kiss him but tries to attack instead. Chad grabs the violet orb and yanks it out of her chest. All of the spiders surrounding the area dies and she also dies.
