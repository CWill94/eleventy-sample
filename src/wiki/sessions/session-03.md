## Highlights
- Baron is named Rick Diggins
- Kobolds are holed up in the ruined castle and are exchanging the townspeople that the bullywogs bring in for weapons
- Baron, Kiv, and Froggertoadman is knocked prone as the zeppelin crashes into a sulfuric smelling bog
- We know that Baron and Froggertoadman are at 1HP
- Lilyblossum is going to fix the blimp, will take 2 hours
- Lilyblossum gives Bart a “Bag of Holding” - carrying capacity is unlimited and items in it have no weight
- Her grandfather made it - Penfile Finchenfeather - the greatest tinkerer in the history of the town
- Oz (with a history check) tells us that the bag is a whole other dimension so putting living creatures gets pretty dicey.
- For bunkering down, Kiv has a bedroll and blanket, Lilyblossum has her own rations and bedroll(?). Frogger and Baron have nothing. Bonathan has nothing. Old Young Kenjamin also has nothing.
- We learn that the Baron looks like Jane’s dad from Tarzan
- He was supposed to give us our goose but it’s back in Billowbarrow… he promises if we ever go back… and if it’s alive…
- Bonathan and Old Young Kenjamin find a chocobo in the forest, they’re with Bart and Oz looking for rations and bedding
- Oz gives his robes to one of the kids for bedding so he’s just… naked
- The chocobo breaks its own neck and now we have at least 4 days worth of rations unless we can find a way to store it better since it’s raw meat
