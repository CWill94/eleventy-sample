## Cosmology and Creation Notes
- Prim as foundational all/nothing magical source
- The Turtle and sibling entities tied to world formation
- Old Star, Old Mother, Lilith, and dragon-line implications

## Artifact Lore
- The Bends of Maerlyn's Rainbow as high-tier relic set
- Red Bend appears displaced from expected stewardship

## Current State
- Time/space instability and wasteland progression are recurring concerns
- Forbidden industrial magic is linked to ecological and arcane disasters
